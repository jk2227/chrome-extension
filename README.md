# Japanese Learning Chrome Extension

This extention aims to recommend reading texts that are appropriate for you. After using it, you will also be given an estimation of how well you understand the articles in NHK Easy,  a Japanese news website for language learners.

It will take around 20 minutes to read all the texts. After that, you will be asked to fill in a survey. The extension may take a few seconds to initialize, and you will see the NHK Easy homepage during that time.

We hope you could enjoy it. Thank you!
