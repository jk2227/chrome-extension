# A Japanese Learning chrome extension that recommends appropriate reading texts for you

This extention aims to recommend reading texts that are appropriate for you. After using it, you will also be given an estimation of how well you understand the articles in NHK Easy,  a Japanese news website for language learners.

To start, just open a new tab and click on our extension! Note that the extension may take a few seconds to initialize, and you will see the NHK Easy homepage during that time. TODO: add description of enable/disable functionality here.

We hope you could enjoy it. Thank you!
