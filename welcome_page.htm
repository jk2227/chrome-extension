<h1 align="center">Welcome to Japanese Language Tutoring System!</h1>

<h2>Study overview</h2>
We are researching methods for second language learning. When using this tool, we will collect anonymous data to improve the tool and understand second language learning better. You will see around 50 Japanese sentences and be asked how well you understand them. Afterwards, you will be given an estimation of how well you can understand articles in NHK Easy, a Japanese news website for language learners. You will also be asked to fill out a survey.<br><br>
The system may take a few seconds to initialize, and you will see the nhk easy homepage during that time. We appreciate your patience.
